# Protein-Function-Prediction
I've developed a machine learning model to predict protein functions from their amino acid sequences. This approach holds immense potential for accelerating drug discovery and understanding biological processes.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    Numpy

Preprocess the data:

    Run the preprocess_data.py script to convert raw protein sequence and function data into the required format for training the model.
Training and Evaluating

    Run the train_eval.py and correct  the files Name as when you run preprocess.py then files will be generated so replace here 
    
    function_file = os.path.join('..' , 'data' ,'protein-functions-2024-02-12-161701.txt')
    sequence_file = os.path.join('..' , 'data' ,'protein-seqs-2024-02-12-151317.txt')
